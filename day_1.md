# Day 1/100: Data Science Journey

## Introduction to Data Science

### What is Data Science?
- **Focus on Specific Problems**: Data Science is about understanding problems through data analysis.
- **Understand and Solve Problems**: It helps in uncovering insights and trends from large datasets.
- **Extract Valuable Information**: Data science is used to turn raw data into actionable insights for decision-making.

### Key Fundamentals of Data Science:
- **Data Collection**: Gathering relevant data from multiple sources.
- **Data Analysis**: Exploring the data to find patterns and trends.
- **Data Cleaning**: Preparing the data for analysis by handling missing or incorrect data.
- **Machine Learning**: Building predictive models that learn from the data.
- **Communication**: Effectively presenting the results to stakeholders.

## Cloud Deployment Models

### Public Cloud
- Shared by a lot of people; anyone can use it over the internet.
- Usually owned by companies like Amazon, Microsoft.

### Private Cloud
- Just for one person/company; hosted by a third party.

### Hybrid Cloud
- Mix of private and public clouds working together.

## Types of Cloud Services

### IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
- Get to use things like storage or servers without buying them.

### PaaS (Platform as a Service)
- Helps build and run apps without worrying about the tech behind the scenes.

### SaaS (Software as a Service)
- Apps you can use directly on the internet (e.g., Google Drive, YouTube).

## Big Data and Processing Tools

- **Big Data**: Large amounts of data comes and collected from multiple sources.
- Requires specific technologies to handle it, e.g., Hadoop.

### Hadoop
- System to store and process large datasets.
- Splits data and distributes it across multiple computers.

### Apache Hive & Spark
- Built on top of Hadoop to handle large datasets.
- Real-time processing using Spark.
